/* Flow Metrics — the offline service worker.
   ==========================================================================
   Ported from the financial-plan repo (by way of Sprint Velocity, which this
   app shares its chrome and most of its plumbing with), where the design and
   its objections are recorded at length. The two facts that make this the most
   security-sensitive file here are worth repeating rather than linking to:

   1. THE PAGE'S CSP DOES NOT APPLY HERE. A worker takes its policy from the
      HTTP response headers of its own script, and GitHub Pages cannot set
      headers — so this code runs with NO Content-Security-Policy at all, and it
      runs resident, surviving reloads. That is why it is deliberately tiny, has
      no dynamic import, no eval, and never fetches anything cross-origin.
      Anything added here should be weighed as if it were running unsandboxed,
      because it is. Keep it short enough to read in one sitting.

   2. CACHE STORAGE IS ORIGIN-WIDE, NOT PER APP. Every app in the family shares
      eagleadams86.github.io, and `caches` is keyed by ORIGIN — so any page on
      that origin can read anything cached here, and the sibling workers
      (financial-plan's `fin-shell-`, Sprint Velocity's `sv-shell-`) sit in the
      same store. The answer is the rule below: only files that are ALREADY PUBLIC in
      this repo are ever cached. Nothing an attacker could read from the cache
      is anything they couldn't read from GitHub. The work items stay in
      localStorage, which every page on the origin could already reach, so
      installing this changes that threat model not at all.
      It cuts the other way too: any same-origin page can also WRITE into this
      cache, so an XSS hole in a sibling app could poison the offline shell, and
      the poison outlives the hole. No per-cache ACL exists; the defence is the
      origin policy itself — a CSP on every page and no third-party script
      anywhere.

   The scope is this file's own directory. Widening it past `/team-dashboard/`
   would need a `Service-Worker-Allowed` header, which Pages cannot send, so
   this worker structurally cannot reach the sibling apps.

   STRATEGY: NETWORK-FIRST, ALWAYS — the cache is a fallback for a network that
   actually failed, never a first choice. That is the whole answer to the
   failure this repo can least afford: stale cached code reading data whose
   shape has since moved. You can only ever be served cached code if the network
   genuinely did not answer, so a change landing while you are online is
   impossible to miss. It costs the speed a cache-first worker would buy, which
   was never the point — offline was.

   The belt to this braces is in index.html: `SCHEMA` and `haltForNewerData`.
   If a saved copy turns out to have been written by a NEWER build than the code
   running here, the app refuses to open it rather than letting hydrateState()
   strip the fields it has never heard of — which here would be written straight
   back to localStorage by loadState() and pushed to every other device.

   If this worker ever misbehaves, it is sticky in a way a broken page is not —
   it can keep serving itself. `sw-kill.js` is the escape hatch: copy it over
   this file, push, and every installed copy uninstalls itself on next load. */

/* Bump when the shell list changes, so old caches are purged on activate. It is
   NOT load-bearing for freshness — network-first means a forgotten bump cannot
   serve you stale code — it only stops dead entries accumulating. */
const CACHE = 'td-shell-v1';
const PREFIX = 'td-shell-';

/* THE ALLOWLIST, and the security boundary of this file. Every entry is a file
   that is already public in the GitHub repo. Nothing else is EVER cached — not
   the work items, not tests.html, not the repo's own notes. A request that is not on this list is not intercepted at all: it goes
   to the network as if this worker did not exist. Adding a line here is a
   security decision, so justify it in the commit. */

  './',
  'chart.min.js',
  'theme.css',
  'privacy.html',
  'favicon.ico'

   localhost (where the app is at the root) and on Pages (where it is under
   /team-dashboard/). Don't hard-code the directory. */
const ROOT = new URL('./', self.location).pathname;
const SHELL_PATHS = new Set(SHELL.map((p) => new URL(p, self.location).pathname));

/* The cache key for a request, or null if it isn't ours to touch. Returning a
   PATH rather than the request strips query strings, and that is load-bearing
   here rather than tidy: the markup asks for `favicon.ico?v=1` in two places,
   and without this the precached `favicon.ico` would never be the entry that
   answers it. `index.html` is folded onto './' for the same reason — both are
   the app, and a share link arriving at either one should work offline. */

/* Fill in whatever the cache is missing, and nothing it already has.
   Two bugs live here, both of which cost offline entirely and neither of which
   announces itself:

   • `cache.addAll` is ALL-OR-NOTHING. One 404 in the list — a file renamed, an
     asset not yet committed — rejects the whole call, install fails, and the
     app has no offline at all while looking perfectly healthy online. Fetching
     each entry on its own degrades instead: a missing file costs that file.

   • INSTALL FIRES ONCE PER SCRIPT VERSION. If the cache is later evicted (a
     browser reclaiming storage, or the user clearing part of their site data)
     the registration survives, no new install event ever runs, and the shell is
     never rebuilt — so offline quietly covers only whatever the last online
     visit happened to request. That is why the page pings this on every load
     (see the `message` handler): the repair has to be able to run without a new
     worker version to hang it on. */
